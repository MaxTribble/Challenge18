# Social Network Back-end

## Description

I created this social network back-end as a starting point for a social network. It is just the beginning stages of a social network site but it is very promising so far. I learned a lot about routes and how to get information that is imbedded in other models.

## Installation and Usage

So far this application is all back-end so you're going to need to run it in your own terminal. To begin, open your terminal in VS code and type "npm i". This will download the necessary packages for the application to run. Then, you will need to type "node index": this will get the server started. You'll need to run queries through a seperate application such as insomnia to see the functionality of the routes. 

Here is an example of how it runs: chrome-extension://mmeijimgabbpbgpdklnllpncmdofkcpn/app.html#/files/d52ba745-2de0-45ea-yadd-4a7564aee58e
